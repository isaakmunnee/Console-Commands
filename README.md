# Console Commands
A dll to make using the console easier :P

Basically this just makes working with the console ten times easier. You can get user specified variables with ease now. You can get variables like floats and stuff that are checked to make sure they are valid so the user can't enter something like "Heil hitler" for a float variable. It will keep asking the user for a variable until it gives you the right one.

There is currently like 50 odd methods for getting variables for:
float, float[], int, int[], decimal, decimal[], double, double[], bool, bool[], string, string[]

There are multiple methods to get each values such as:
- prompt, which allows you to tell the user what they're entering
- clear, to clear the console after each variable input
- incorrectMessage, what to tell the user if they don't enter a valid input
- length, for array length if you don't want the user to decide
- arrayLengthPrompt and newMessage, for arrays to customise what the user is shown

each type has default values :P

I'm not a pro, but if you have any bugs suggestions or code or whatever, feel more then free to contact me on isaakmunnee@gmail.com or message me on here or something.
