Eventuall this'll be like neat and cool I guess, unless I find something that does this (which i probably will in the next 20 minutes xD), but basically this can

Get a user specified
int, float, double, decimal, string, bool

Get a user specified array of
int, float, double, decimal, string, bool
(with the option for a user specified length)

and that's it atm lol
